# Food_CNN_Classifier
This repository contains the code for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to classify images of food items into one of five categories: pizza, burger, ice cream, samosa, and sushi. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras and demonstrates a complete workflow from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
